## DITCH THE BRICK
A fun, humorous ad campaign to entice customers to purchase new Intel laptops. Though it was a static landing page, it wasn't a simple project. Due to the number of participating retailers like Walmart and Staples, I had to build a page that allowed for slight product and content variations. Using Gulp and Nunjucks Templating Engine, it was easy to keep one code base up-to-date across all retailers.
